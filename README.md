ftp2http
========

An FTP server that pushes uploaded files directly to a HTTP URL.


Overview
========

Think of ftp2http as a simple FTP layer that sits before a HTTP server.

An FTP client connects to an ftp2http server and uploads a file. The ftp2http
server immediately uploads that file to the configured HTTP URL.

The server directory always appears empty to the client, even after a file has
been uploaded. This is because uploaded files are only sent to the HTTP server,
not stored.


Installation
=======================

Install ftp2http by using pip, a tool for managing Python packages.

1. Run `pip install ftp2http`
2. Create a configuration file at `/etc/ftp2http.conf`
  * Example: https://github.com/apn-online/ftp2http/blob/master/conf/ftp2http.conf


Usage
=====

* Run `ftp2http`

We use **circusd** to manage the ftp2http process. An example configuration has
been provided in the **examples** directory.


Authentication
============

Authentication can be checked against user accounts specified in the
configuration file, or by configuring an authentication backend URL.

User accounts in the the configuration file
-------------------------------------------

A specific configuration format is used, which can be generated using the
`ftp2http -a` command.

Example:

    $ ftp2http -a
    Enter a username: dogman
    Enter a password:
    Confirm password:
    
    Add the following line to your configuration file.
    user: dogman:$2a$12$5NyFA4AbEfmZiexG62qIieBu/isqwTYnta8H9gH5zC0lCRVKyMrc.

HTTP Basic Authentication
-------------------------

FTP login authentication can be performed via HTTP requests, using HTTP basic
authentication. Set one or more **authentication_backend** entries in the
configuration file, and then ftp2http will perform requests to check the FTP
login details. Login details are accepted if an authentication_backend URL
returns a 2xx response.

File uploads themselves can also use HTTP basic authentication. By enabling
**http_basic_auth** in the configuration file, ftp2http will reuse the FTP
login details for HTTP basic authentication when sending uploaded files
to the target URL.
